Modern warfare demands adaptive, real-time defense against hypersonic threats, space-based weapons, and electronic warfare. This research integrates fractal mathematics, gravitational warping, plasma shielding, and AI-driven optimization to revolutionize space-based missile interception and stealth communications.

Fractal radar systems use wavelet decomposition to enhance the tracking of maneuverable threats, while plasma shielding enables dynamic stealth cloaking and energy absorption. Gravitational warping disrupts missile trajectories, making conventional interception obsolete. In secure communications, fractal antennas and quantum cryptography provide resilient, jamming-resistant satellite networks, while AI-driven signal intelligence counters electronic warfare threats in real time.

With applications in military defense, space security, and quantum-resistant encryption, this research pioneers next-generation protection strategies for critical assets in an era of rapidly evolving threats.
